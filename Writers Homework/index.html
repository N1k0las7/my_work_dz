            <h1>Nikolai Gogol</h1>
            <hr>
            From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
            <br>
            <p> Nikolai Vasilyevich Gogol[a] (1 April [O.S. 20 March] 1809 – 4 March [O.S. 21 February] 1852) was a
                Russian novelist, short story writer and playwright of Ukrainian origin.
                <br>
                Gogol was one of the first to use the technique of the grotesque, in works such as "The Nose", "Viy",
                "The Overcoat", and "Nevsky Prospekt". These stories, and others such as "Diary of a Madman", have also
                been noted for their proto-surrealist qualities. According to Viktor Shklovsky, Gogol's strange style of
                writing resembles the "ostranenie" technique of defamiliarization. His early works, such as Evenings on
                a Farm Near Dikanka, were influenced by his Ukrainian upbringing, Ukrainian culture and folklore. His
                later writing satirised political corruption in contemporary Russia (The Government Inspector, Dead
                Souls), although Gogol also enjoyed the patronage of Tsar Nicholas I who liked his work. The novel Taras
                Bulba (1835), the play Marriage (1842), and the short stories "The Tale of How Ivan Ivanovich Quarreled
                with Ivan Nikiforovich", "The Portrait" and "The Carriage", are also among his best-known works.
                <br>
                Many writers and critics have recognized Gogol's huge influence on Russian, Ukrainian and world
                literature. Gogol's influence was acknowledged by Fyodor Dostoevsky, Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin,
                Ryūnosuke Akutagawa, Franz Kafka, Mikhail Bulgakov, Vladimir Nabokov, Flannery O'Connor and others.
                Eugène-Melchior de Vogüé said: "We all came out from under Gogol's Overcoat."
                Gogol was born in the Ukrainian Cossack town of Sorochyntsi, in the Poltava Governorate of the Russian
                Empire. His mother was descended from Leonty Kosyarovsky, an officer of the Lubny Regiment in 1710. His
                father Vasily Gogol-Yanovsky, who died when Gogol was 15 years old, was supposedly a descendant of
                Ukrainian Cossacks (see Lyzohub family) and belonged to the 'petty gentry'. His father wrote poetry in
                Ukrainian as well as Russian, and was an amateur playwright in his own theatre. As was typical of the
                left-bank Ukrainian gentry of the early nineteenth century, the family spoke Ukrainian as well as
                Russian. As a child, Gogol helped stage plays in his uncle's home theater.
                <br>
                In 1820, Nikolai Gogol went to a school of higher art in Nezhin (Nizhyn) (now Nizhyn Gogol State
                University) and remained there until 1828. It was there that he began writing. He was not popular among
                his schoolmates, who called him their "mysterious dwarf", but with two or three of them he formed
                lasting friendships. Very early he developed a dark and secretive disposition, marked by a painful
                self-consciousness and boundless ambition. Equally early he developed a talent for mimicry, which later
                made him a matchless reader of his own works and induced him to toy with the idea of becoming an actor.
                <br>
                On leaving school in 1828, Gogol went to Saint Petersburg, full of vague but ambitious hopes. He desired
                literary fame, and brought with him a Romantic poem of German idyllic life – Hans Küchelgarten, and had
                it published at his own expense, under the pseudonym "V. Alov." The magazines he sent it to almost
                universally derided it. He bought all the copies and destroyed them, swearing never to write poetry
                again.
